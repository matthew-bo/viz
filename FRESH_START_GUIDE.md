# 🔥 Fresh Start - Simple Guide

**Status:** Both servers starting clean

---

## ✅ What I Just Did:

1. ✅ Killed ALL Node processes
2. ✅ Freed all ports (3000, 3001, 3002)
3. ✅ Started backend with FIXED code
4. ✅ Started frontend with fixes

---

## 🎯 What YOU Need to Do:

### Step 1: Wait 20 seconds
Let both servers fully start

### Step 2: Check Your Terminals

**Backend Terminal Should Show:**
```
✓ Backend server running on port 3001
Ready to accept requests!
```

**Frontend Terminal Should Show:**
```
VITE v5.4.20  ready in XXXms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```
(Or possibly 3002 if 3000 was busy)

### Step 3: Open Browser
Go to the URL shown by Vite (http://localhost:3000 or :3002)

### Step 4: Hard Refresh
Press: **`Ctrl + Shift + R`**

### Step 5: Test Accept Button
1. Create exchange OR use existing one
2. Click "Accept Transaction"
3. **Watch the BACKEND terminal**

---

## 🔍 What to Look For in Backend Terminal:

### ✅ GOOD (Fix is working):
```
POST /api/exchanges/ex_.../accept
✓ Skipping re-validation - assets already locked in escrow
Executing exchange ex_...
Exchange ex_... completed successfully
```

### ❌ BAD (Old code still running somehow):
```
POST /api/exchanges/ex_.../accept
Exchange validation failed on acceptance: [ 'Cannot request asset that receiver does not own' ]
```

## 📊 Summary:

| Component | Port | Status | URL |
|-----------|------|--------|-----|
| Backend | 3001 | Starting | N/A (API only) |
| Frontend | 3000 or 3002 | Starting | Check your terminal |

**Wait 20 seconds, then test!**
