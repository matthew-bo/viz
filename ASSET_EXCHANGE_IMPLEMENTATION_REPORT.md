## üìä Implementation Overview

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation ‚úÖ

#### New Data Models (`backend/src/models/`)
1. **Asset.ts** - Core asset type definitions
   - `RealEstateAsset` interface (name, location, property type, value, ownership history)
   - `PrivateEquityAsset` interface (name, industry, valuation, ownership history)
   - `OwnershipHistory` tracking for complete audit trail

2. **Inventory.ts** - Party inventory management
   - `PartyInventory` interface (cash balance, owned real estate, owned private equity)
   - `InventorySnapshot` for detailed API responses

3. **Exchange.ts** - Exchange proposal system

## üéØ Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. **Two-Sided Exchange Model**
Unlike traditional payment systems, this supports **barter-style exchanges**:
- Cash for Asset: "I'll give you $100M for the Empire State Building"
- Asset for Cash: "I'll sell you TechCorp for $180M"
- Asset for Asset: "I'll trade Salesforce Tower for Chrysler Building + $50M cash"

### 2. **Complete Ownership Tracking**
Every asset maintains:
- Current owner
- Full ownership history
- Exchange context (what was traded for what)
- Timestamps for all transfers

### 3. **Real-time Inventory Management**
- Cash balances update immediately
- Asset ownership transfers atomically
- Inventory reflects in BusinessPanel instantly
- Transaction history preserved

### 4. **Validation & Safety**
- **Ownership Verification**: Can't trade what you don't own
- **Balance Checks**: Insufficient cash prevents exchange
- **Atomic Transfers**: Both sides execute or neither does
- **Audit Trail**: Every change is logged

### 5. **Co-existence with Legacy System**
- Old transaction/payment system still works
- New exchange system operates independently
- Both share same party infrastructure
- Smooth migration path

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Docker & Docker Compose installed
2. Ports 3000, 3001, 7011 available
3. All code files in place

### Step 1: Build & Start
```bash
# Stop any running containers
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose-simple.yml down

# Build (this is running in background now)
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose-simple.yml build --no-cache

# Start all services
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose-simple.yml up -d

# Verify services
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose-simple.yml ps
```

### Step 2: Access Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- Health Check: http://localhost:3001/health

### Step 3: Verify Asset Seeding
Check backend logs:
```bash
docker logs backend
```

You should see:
```
üå± Seeding assets...
üìç Creating Real Estate Assets:
  ‚úì Empire State Building ‚Üí TechBank ($2300M)
  ...
üíº Creating Private Equity Assets:
  ‚úì TechCorp Industries ‚Üí TechBank ($180M)
  ...
```

### Step 4: UI Exploration

#### A. View Inventories
1. In left sidebar (BusinessPanel), click on any party card
2. Scroll down to see "Asset Inventory" section
3. Click to expand and view:
   - Cash balance (always visible)
   - Real estate properties
   - Private equity holdings

#### B. Create an Exchange
1. Click **"CREATE"** button in header
2. **Select Parties**:
   - From: TechBank
   - To: GlobalCorp
3. **I OFFER Section**:
   - Type: Real Estate
   - Property: Empire State Building
4. **I REQUEST Section**:
   - Type: Cash
   - Amount: 2,000,000,000 ($2B)

curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/exchanges/{EXCHANGE_ID}/accept \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"acceptingParty": "{RECEIVER_PARTY_ID}"}'
```

#### D. Verify Inventory Update
1. Refresh the page
2. Check TechBank inventory - Empire State Building should be gone
3. Check GlobalCorp inventory - Empire State Building should appear
4. Cash balances should update accordingly

### Step 5: API Testing

#### Get Inventories
```bash
# All inventories
curl http://localhost:3001/api/inventory

# Specific party
curl http://localhost:3001/api/inventory/{PARTY_ID}
```

#### Get Assets
