# ðŸ”§ Fixes In Progress

## Issue #1: Transaction Timeline Not Showing Exchange Details
**Problem:** Even though we implemented the exchange display, it's still showing one-way

**Root Cause Investigation:**
- Added debug logging to see if `isExchange` is being detected
- Check browser console for: `TransactionTimeline Debug`
- Look for `templateId: 'Exchange:AssetExchange'`

## Issue #2: Asset History Not Showing Initial Owner Clearly  
**Problem:** The diagram doesn't clearly show who currently owns the asset

**Solution Being Implemented:**
- Add a "Current Owner" highlight at the END of the timeline
- Make the current owner card visually distinct (green border, badge)
- Add clear labeling

## Issue #3: Inventory Not Updating After Acceptance
**Problem:** After clicking "Accept", assets don't move until page refresh

**Root Cause:** No inventory refetch after exchange completion

**Solution:** 
- Find where acceptance happens
- Add `apiClient.getAllInventories()` call after success
- Update BusinessPanel state
