## 🔬 Test Categories Explained

### Section 5.1: Infrastructure Health Checks
**Purpose:** Verify Canton blockchain is operational  
**Tests:** 4 automated scripts  
**Validates:**
- All 4 Canton containers running (sync + 3 participants)
- Domain `mydomain` bootstrapped correctly
- All 3 parties created with valid Canton IDs
- Smart contract DAR uploaded to all participants

**Critical for:** Ensuring blockchain foundation is solid

---

### Section 5.2: API Integration Tests
**Purpose:** Verify backend REST API correctness  
**Tests:** 6 automated scripts  
**Validates:**
- Health endpoint returns correct status
- Parties endpoint returns all 3 parties
- Submit endpoint creates PaymentRequest (pending)
- Accept endpoint creates Payment (committed)
- Query endpoint respects party filtering
- SSE endpoint broadcasts real-time updates

**Critical for:** Ensuring API contract stability

---

### Section 5.3: Privacy Validation Tests
**Purpose:** Verify Canton privacy enforcement at ledger level  
**Tests:** 2 automated scripts  
**Validates:**
- Two-party transaction not visible to third party
- Complete visibility matrix across all party combinations
- Privacy persists after transaction commitment
- No data leakage between independent transactions

**Critical for:** **PRIVACY IS THE CORE VALUE PROPOSITION** ⚠️

**If privacy tests fail → Privacy violation → DO NOT DEPLOY**

---

### Section 5.4: End-to-End UI Tests
**Purpose:** Verify complete user workflow  
**Tests:** 1 comprehensive manual checklist (50+ steps)  
**Validates:**
- Page load and initial state
- Transaction submission with real-time updates
- Privacy filtering (sender/receiver/third-party views)
- Accept workflow with status transitions
- Canton metadata display
- Form validation
- Page refresh persistence

**Critical for:** User experience quality

---

### Section 5.5: Performance & Load Tests
**Purpose:** Verify performance meets targets  
**Targets:**
- SSE latency: <100ms from submit to UI update
- Query performance: <200ms for party-filtered queries
- No race conditions in concurrent transactions
- Acceptable browser resource usage

**Critical for:** Production scalability
