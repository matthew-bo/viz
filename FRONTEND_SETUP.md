# Frontend Setup & Testing Guide

## 🎉 Frontend Implementation Complete!

All files have been created. Here's how to run it:

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

✅ Backend running on port 3001  
✅ Canton network initialized with real party IDs  
✅ Node.js 20+ installed

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```powershell
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install all dependencies (React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, etc.)
npm install
```

**Expected output:**
- Installs ~15 packages
- Creates `node_modules/` directory
- Takes ~30-60 seconds

### Step 2: Create Environment File

```powershell
# Create .env file with API URL
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001" > .env
```

Or create `.env` manually:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Step 3: Start Development Server

```powershell
# Start Vite dev server
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
  VITE v5.0.8  ready in 500 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

### Step 4: Open in Browser

Open: http://localhost:3000

You should see:
- ✅ Canton Privacy Blockchain header
- ✅ Green "Live" indicator (if backend connected)
- ✅ Submit Payment Request form
- ✅ Privacy Filter sidebar
- ✅ Transactions grid (empty initially)
- ✅ Blue help button (?) in bottom-right

---

## 🧪 Testing the Frontend

### Test 1: Connection Status

1. ✅ Green "Live" indicator should appear in top-right
2. If gray "Connecting..." appears:
   - Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
   - Check browser console for errors

### Test 2: Submit Payment Request

1. Fill out form:
   - **From**: TechBank
   - **To**: GlobalCorp
   - **Amount**: 1000
   - **Description**: Test payment
2. Click "Submit to Canton Network"
3. ✅ Success message appears
4. ✅ Transaction card appears immediately (via SSE)
5. ✅ Status badge shows "Pending Acceptance" (yellow)

### Test 3: Privacy Filtering

1. Click "View As: RetailFinance" in sidebar
2. ✅ Transaction disappears (RetailFinance not involved)
3. Click "View As: TechBank"
4. ✅ Transaction reappears (TechBank is sender)
5. Click "View As: GlobalCorp"
6. ✅ Transaction visible (GlobalCorp is receiver)

### Test 4: Accept Workflow

1. Ensure viewing as GlobalCorp
2. ✅ Green "Accept Payment" button appears on pending transaction
3. Click "Accept Payment"
4. ✅ Status changes to "Committed" (green)
5. ✅ "Committed at" timestamp appears
6. ✅ Accept button disappears

### Test 5: Real-Time Updates

1. Open two browser windows side-by-side
2. Window 1: View as TechBank
3. Window 2: View as GlobalCorp
4. Submit transaction in Window 1
5. ✅ Transaction appears in both windows instantly (<100ms)

### Test 6: Canton Explainer

1. Click blue "?" button in bottom-right
2. ✅ Modal opens with Canton explanation
3. ✅ Read through features, comparison table
4. Click "Got it, let's explore!"
5. ✅ Modal closes

### Test 7: Responsive Design

1. Resize browser window to mobile width (320px)
2. ✅ Layout adapts to single column
3. ✅ All content readable and accessible
4. ✅ Buttons remain clickable

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "npm install" fails

```powershell
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item package-lock.json

# Retry install
npm install
```

### Issue: Port 3000 already in use

```powershell
# Change port in vite.config.ts
# Or kill process on port 3000:
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process
```

### Issue: SSE not connecting

1. Check backend is running:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

2. Check browser console (F12) for errors

3. Verify VITE_API_URL in .env:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```

4. Restart frontend server:
   ```powershell
   # Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev
   ```

### Issue: Transactions not appearing

1. Check backend logs:
   ```powershell
   cd ..\backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test API directly:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:3001/api/contracts | ConvertFrom-Json
   ```

3. Check Canton containers:
   ```powershell
   docker ps
   ```

### Issue: Accept button not showing

- ✅ Ensure transaction status is "pending"
- ✅ Ensure selected party matches receiver
- ✅ Example: TechBank → GlobalCorp, view as GlobalCorp

### Issue: CORS errors

Backend should have CORS enabled in `backend/src/server.ts`:
```typescript
app.use(cors());
```

| SSE Connection | <500ms | Watch "Live" indicator turn green |
| Transaction Update | <100ms | Submit and watch for card appearance |
| Privacy Filter | Instant | Click party, watch grid update |
| Accept Action | <500ms | Click accept, watch status change |
