## 🎯 JUST COMPLETED: API Timeout Integration

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/api/client.ts` (All 15 API methods)

**What Was Done:**
- ✅ Integrated fetchWithTimeout into all API methods
- ✅ Added intelligent timeout values (10s health, 15s default, 30s bulk)
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with getErrorMessage()
- ✅ Improved user-facing error text
- ✅ Comprehensive activity logging

**Impact:**
- No more infinite loading states
- Clear timeout errors for users
- Better network resilience
- Improved debugging capability
