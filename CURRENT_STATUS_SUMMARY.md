## 🚨 Critical Missing Items (Phase 6)

### **Priority 1: Environment Files (MUST DO FIRST)**

**backend/.env**
```bash
Status: ❌ MISSING
Template: ✅ EXISTS (backend/env.template)
Action: Copy env.template to .env
Contains: Real party IDs, participant URLs, JWT secret
Time: 2 minutes
```

**frontend/.env**
```bash
Status: ❌ MISSING
Action: Create new file
Contents: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup (3 minutes)
```powershell
# Create backend .env
cd backend
copy env.template .env

# Create frontend .env
cd ../frontend
echo VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001 > .env
```

### Step 2: Verify Local Stack Works (5 minutes)
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start Canton
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d
# Wait 30 seconds
.\init-canton-final.ps1

# Terminal 2: Start backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Browser: Open http://localhost:3000
# Expected: Green "Live" indicator, 3 parties loaded
```

### Step 3: Choose Your Path

**Path A: Minimum Viable Demo (2 hours)**
- Skip Dockerfiles
- Complete DEMO.md script
- Take screenshots
- Practice demo
- **Result:** Ready for local demo to recruiters

**Path B: Full Deployment (6 hours)**
- Create all Dockerfiles
- Update docker-compose.yml
- Complete DEMO.md
- Take screenshots
- Deploy to Railway/Fly.io
- **Result:** Public URL + local demo ready

**Path C: Documentation Only (1 hour)**
- Complete DEMO.md
- Update README
- Take screenshots
- **Result:** Excellent documentation, local demo only

## 🚀 Ready to Proceed?

**You are at the final stretch!**

Phase 6 is about **packaging and presentation**, not building new features.

**Recommended:** Start with Path A (Minimum Viable Demo) to get something demo-ready quickly, then optionally upgrade to Path B if you want cloud deployment.

**Next Command:**
```powershell
# Read the detailed plan
Get-Content PHASE6_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md

# Or start immediately with environment setup
cd backend
copy env.template .env
```

---

**Questions to decide:**
1. Do you want to deploy to cloud, or demo locally?
2. Do you have budget for Railway ($20/mo) or Fly.io ($25/mo)?
3. When do you need to show this to recruiters?

Let me know your answers and we'll execute the perfect Phase 6 plan! 🚀
