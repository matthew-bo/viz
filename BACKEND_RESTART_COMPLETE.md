# 🔄 Backend Restart Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** ✅ Backend should now be running on port 3001

---

## 🔍 **What Was Wrong:**

The error you saw:
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
```

**Root Cause:** Backend wasn't running!

When the frontend tried to fetch data from `http://localhost:3001/api/parties`, it failed because the backend server was stuck. The port 3001 was occupied by a zombie process.

---

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Identified zombie processes** on port 3001 (PIDs: 14588, 4100, 18304)
2. **Killed all processes** using `Stop-Process -Force`
3. **Started fresh backend** on port 3001
4. **Frontend still running** on port 3002

---

## 📊 **Current Status:**

| Service | Status | Port | URL |
|---------|--------|------|-----|
| Backend | ✅ Starting | 3001 | http://localhost:3001 |
| Frontend | ✅ Running | 3002 | http://localhost:3002 |

---

## 🧪 **NEXT STEPS - Follow These Exactly:**

### Step 1: Verify Backend Started
**Check your terminal for this message:**
```
✅ Asset seeding complete!
...
Server running on port 3001
```

**If you see errors instead:**
- Screenshot the error
- Send it to me
- I'll troubleshoot

---

### Step 2: Open Browser
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3002**

---

### Step 3: Hard Refresh
Press: **`Ctrl + Shift + R`**

This clears the old cached code and forces a fresh load.

---

### Step 4: Open Console
Press: **`F12`** to open Developer Tools

---

### Step 5: Check for Success
**You should see these console logs:**
```
✅ Inventories refreshed: 3 parties
TransactionTimeline Debug: {...}
```

**If you see these:** ✅ Everything is working!

**If you see errors:** ❌ Send me the error message

---

## 🎯 **What to Test:**

### Test 1: App Loads
- [ ] No error page
- [ ] See 3 business entities on left
- [ ] See transactions in center

**Expected:** App loads successfully

---

### Test 2: Exchange Display
1. Click "CREATE" button
2. Create an exchange:
   - From: TechBank
   - To: GlobalCorp
   - Offering: $50,000 cash
   - Requesting: One World Trade Center (real estate)
3. Click on the created exchange
4. **Check console** for `TransactionTimeline Debug`

**Expected:**
```javascript
TransactionTimeline Debug: {
  isExchange: true, // ✅ Should be true
  templateId: "Exchange:AssetExchange",
  exchangeDetails: {
    offering: { type: "cash", cashAmount: 50000 },
    requesting: { type: "real_estate", assetId: "...", assetName: "One World Trade Center" }
  }
}
```

---

### Test 3: Current Owner Display
1. Click on "GlobalCorp" in BusinessPanel
2. Click on "One World Trade Center"
3. Scroll timeline to the right

**Expected:**
- Big green card at the end
- Says "CURRENT OWNER"
- Shows "GlobalCorp"

---

### Test 4: Real-Time Inventory Updates
1. Accept an exchange
2. **Don't refresh the page**
3. Watch the BusinessPanel

**Expected:**
- Console shows: `✅ Inventories refreshed: 3 parties`
- Assets move between parties within 1-2 seconds
- No page refresh needed

---

## 🚨 **If You Still See Errors:**

### Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined"
**Cause:** Backend still isn't running

**Fix:**
1. Check terminal - do you see "Server running on port 3001"?
2. If not, manually restart:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\mbo1\viz\backend
npm run dev
```

---

### Error: "Failed to fetch"
**Cause:** Backend is running but not responding

**Fix:**
1. Check if Canton containers are running (if using Docker)
2. Try: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
3. Should return JSON with health status

---

### Error: Console shows old code (no debug logs)
**Cause:** Browser cache not cleared

**Fix:**
1. Close ALL tabs of the app
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Check "Disable cache"
5. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

---

## 📋 **Verification Checklist:**

Before testing the three issues:

- [ ] Terminal shows "Server running on port 3001"
- [ ] Browser is at http://localhost:3002
- [ ] Hard refreshed with Ctrl+Shift+R
- [ ] Console open (F12)
- [ ] Console shows `✅ Inventories refreshed`
- [ ] Console shows `TransactionTimeline Debug` when viewing transaction
- [ ] No errors in console

**If all 7 = YES:** ✅ Ready to test features!

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

1. **Keep Console Open** - You'll see all the debug logs I added
2. **Look for Green Checkmarks** - `✅ Inventories refreshed` means new code is running
3. **Check isExchange Value** - This tells us if exchanges are being created correctly
4. **Watch Network Tab** - See API calls to backend

---

## 🎉 **Expected Results After Restart:**

### What Should Work Now:
1. ✅ App loads without errors
2. ✅ Debug logging appears in console
3. ✅ Current owner card shows in asset history
4. ✅ Inventory updates in real-time

### What to Check:
1. Is `isExchange: true` for exchanges?
2. Do you see both offering and requesting in timeline?
3. Is the current owner card clearly visible?
4. Do inventories update without refresh?
