# üîÑ Server Restart - Fresh Changes Applied

**Status:** Servers restarting with ALL changes

---

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Changes ARE in the code

I verified that all three fixes are present in the source files:

1. ‚úÖ `TransactionTimeline.tsx` - Has debug logging (line 38)
2. ‚úÖ `AssetHistoryView.tsx` - Has "CURRENT OWNER" card (line 255)
3. ‚úÖ `BusinessPanel.tsx` - Has `transactions` dependency (line 95)

**The problem was:** Changes weren't applied to the running dev server

---

## üîÑ What I Just Did:

1. **Stopped all Node processes** - Killed old servers
2. **Starting backend** - Port 3001
3. **Starting frontend** - Port 3000 (or next available)

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è WAIT FOR SERVERS TO START (30 seconds)

### Check your terminal for:

**Backend:**
```
Server running on port 3001
```

**Frontend:**
```
VITE v5.4.20  ready in XXXms
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

---

## üß™ THEN TEST:

### 1. Open the NEW URL shown in terminal
   Example: http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3002

### 2. Hard Refresh the Browser
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Or: `Ctrl + F5`
   - This clears old cached JavaScript

### 3. Open Console (F12)
   - Should see fresh console logs

### 4. Create an Exchange
   - From: Alice
   - To: Bob  
   - Offering: $10,000
   - Requesting: Real Estate #101

### 5. Click on the Exchange
   - Look in console for: `TransactionTimeline Debug`
   - This proves the new code is running

---

## üîç How to Verify Changes Applied:

### Test #1: Debug Logging (TransactionTimeline)
**Open Console ‚Üí Create Exchange ‚Üí Click It**

**You SHOULD see:**
```javascript
TransactionTimeline Debug: {
  contractId: "ex_...",
  templateId: "...",
  isExchange: true/false,
  exchangeDetails: {...}
}
```

**If you DON'T see this log:** 
- Old code is still running
- Try closing ALL browser tabs
- Open fresh tab to the URL

---

### Test #2: Current Owner Card (AssetHistoryView)
**BusinessPanel ‚Üí Click any Asset ‚Üí View History**

**You SHOULD see:**
- Green card at END of timeline
- Says "CURRENT OWNER" in corner
- Shows owner's name large

**If you DON'T see green card:**
- Old code still running
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

---

### Test #3: Real-Time Updates (BusinessPanel)
**Console should show:**
```
‚úÖ Inventories refreshed: 3 parties
```

**This log proves the new code is running**

---

## üö® IF CHANGES STILL DON'T APPEAR:

### Option 1: Manual Server Restart
```powershell
# Stop servers
Ctrl+C in both terminal windows

# Restart backend
cd C:\Users\mbo1\viz\backend
npm run dev

# Restart frontend (new terminal)
cd C:\Users\mbo1\viz\frontend
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 3: Force Rebuild
```powershell
cd C:\Users\mbo1\viz\frontend
npm run build
npm run dev
```

---

## üìä VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before testing features, verify new code is running:

- [ ] Console shows `TransactionTimeline Debug` when viewing transaction
- [ ] Console shows `‚úÖ Inventories refreshed` when page loads
- [ ] AssetHistoryView shows green "CURRENT OWNER" card
- [ ] No errors in console about missing functions

**If ALL four checkboxes = YES:** New code is running!

---

## üéØ WHAT TO DO NEXT:

### If New Code IS Running:
1. Test the exchange display (check console for `isExchange` value)
2. Test the current owner display (look for green card)
3. Test inventory updates (accept exchange, watch for changes)
4. Send me feedback on what you see

### If New Code NOT Running:
1. Check terminal for server errors
2. Try manual restart (see Option 1 above)
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Send me screenshot of terminal output

---

## üí° TIPS:

**Best Practice:**
- Always hard refresh after code changes
- Check console first before testing features
- Look for the debug logs to confirm new code

**Quick Test:**
- Type in console: `console.log('test')`
- If you don't see it, DevTools might be filtered
- Click "Default levels" to show all logs

**Servers are restarting now...**
**Wait 30 seconds then check the terminal for the URL!**
