## 🚀 Start Here (Right Now)

### Step 1: Create Environment Files

**Backend .env (2 minutes):**
```powershell
cd backend
copy env.template .env
notepad .env  # Verify party IDs match infrastructure/canton/party-ids.json
```

**Frontend .env (1 minute):**
```powershell
cd frontend
echo VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001 > .env
```

### Step 2: Test Local Stack

**Terminal 1 - Canton:**
```powershell
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d
timeout /t 30 /nobreak
.\init-canton-final.ps1
```

**Terminal 2 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd backend
npm run dev
# Should see: "Backend server running on port 3001"
```

**Terminal 3 - Frontend:**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Should see: "Local: http://localhost:5173/"
```

**Browser:**
```
Open: http://localhost:5173 (or 3000, depending on Vite)
Expected:
✅ Green "Live" connection indicator
✅ System Status shows healthy
✅ 3 parties loaded (TechBank, GlobalCorp, RetailFinance)
✅ No console errors
```

### Step 3: Choose Your Path
- If everything works → Decide Path A/B/C
- If errors → Check logs, fix issues

## 📝 DEMO.md Template (Quick Fill)

**Save time:** Use this template for your 5-minute demo script:

### Part 1: Introduction (30s)
```
"This is a privacy-preserving blockchain application built on Canton Network.
It demonstrates real-time multi-party transactions with ledger-level privacy.

Key features:
- 3 independent blockchain participants
- Privacy: transactions only visible to involved parties
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- Multi-party signature workflow"
```

### Part 2: Submit Transaction (60s)
```
"Let me submit a payment request from TechBank to GlobalCorp.

[Fill form: Sender=TechBank, Receiver=GlobalCorp, Amount=$1000]
[Click Submit]

Notice:
✅ Transaction appears immediately (SSE real-time)
✅ Status is 'Pending Acceptance' (yellow)
✅ Activity Log tracks the submission
✅ Only sender signature so far"
```

### Part 3: Accept Payment (90s)
```
"Now let's switch to GlobalCorp's view to accept this payment.

[Click Privacy Filter: GlobalCorp]
[Click Accept Payment button]

Notice:
✅ Status changes to 'Committed' (green)
✅ Both parties now signed (multi-party signature)
✅ committedAt timestamp added
✅ Real-time update across all views"
```

### Part 4: Privacy Demo (90s)
```
"Here's the key feature - privacy. Let's switch to RetailFinance's view.

[Click Privacy Filter: RetailFinance]

Notice:
✅ The transaction completely disappears
✅ This is enforced at the Canton ledger level, not just UI filtering
✅ RetailFinance's ledger queries return empty - they have no access
✅ This is true privacy, not access control"
```

### Part 5: Technical Highlights (60s)
```
"Technical stack:
- Canton 2.7.6 blockchain (3 participants + synchronizer)
- Daml smart contracts (PaymentRequest → Payment)
- TypeScript backend with Canton integration
- React frontend with real-time SSE
- Activity logging and system monitoring

[Expand transaction card to show Canton metadata]
[Show Activity Log with full operation history]
[Show System Status panel with health indicators]

## 🔥 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Cannot find module '.env'"
```powershell
# Backend needs .env file
cd backend
copy env.template .env
```

### Issue: "Network error" in frontend
```powershell
# Frontend needs .env file
cd frontend
echo VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001 > .env
# Restart Vite dev server
```

### Issue: "Party IDs not found"
```powershell
# Re-initialize Canton
cd infrastructure
.\init-canton-final.ps1
# Update backend/.env with new party IDs
```

### Issue: Docker containers not running
```powershell
# Start Docker Desktop
# Then:
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d
```

### Issue: Port 3001 already in use
```powershell
# Kill existing backend process
Get-Process -Name node | Stop-Process -Force
# Or change port in backend/.env: PORT=3002
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Recruiters
- ✅ **Practice the demo 3 times** before the call
- ✅ **Clear transactions before demo** for fresh start
- ✅ **Have Activity Log expanded** to show professionalism
- ✅ **Mention tech stack** (Canton, TypeScript, React)

### For Code Review
- ✅ **Point to ActivityLog.tsx** - shows advanced state management
- ✅ **Point to SystemStatus.tsx** - shows monitoring capability
- ✅ **Point to test suite** - shows professional practices
- ✅ **Point to TypeScript strict mode** - shows code quality

### For Interview Questions
- ✅ **"Hardest part?"** → Canton integration and real-time SSE
- ✅ **"How long?"** → 7 days following a detailed plan
- ✅ **"What would you improve?"** → PostgreSQL persistence, auth, more contract types
- ✅ **"Why Canton?"** → True privacy at ledger level, not just access control
