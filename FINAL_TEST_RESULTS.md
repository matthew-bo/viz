## üêõ Known Issues & Future Work

### Known Limitations
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exchange accept UI**: Not integrated into transaction timeline yet
   - **Workaround**: Use API directly (documented above)
   - **Future**: Add accept button to main UI

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exchange timeline view**: Exchanges don't show in main timeline
   - **Workaround**: View via API /api/exchanges
   - **Future**: Create unified transaction + exchange view

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Multi-asset bundles**: Can't do "2 properties + $50M" in one exchange
   - **Workaround**: Do multiple sequential exchanges
   - **Future**: Support complex bundles

### Recommended Enhancements
- [ ] Exchange timeline view component
- [ ] Accept button integration in UI
- [ ] Asset detail modal (click to see history)
- [ ] Exchange status filtering
- [ ] Database migration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- [ ] Multi-asset bundle support
- [ ] Counter-offer system
- [ ] Market price tracking
- [ ] Portfolio analytics dashboard
- [ ] Export inventory reports

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Starting
```bash
docker logs backend
```
Look for errors in asset seeding or route mounting.

### Frontend Not Loading
```bash
docker logs frontend
```
Check for build errors or port conflicts.

### Exchange Creation Fails
1. Check console for validation errors
2. Verify party has sufficient cash
3. Confirm asset ownership
4. Check Activity Log (download JSON export from header)

### Inventory Not Loading
1. Check backend health: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
2. Test inventory API: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/inventory`
3. Check browser console for API errors

---

## üìû Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ **Test Exchange Creation**: Try creating an exchange in the UI
2. ‚úÖ **Test API Endpoints**: Use curl commands to verify all endpoints work
3. ‚úÖ **View Inventories**: Explore the BusinessPanel inventory sections
4. ‚úÖ **Check Activity Log**: Download logs from header dropdown

### Future Development
1. **Phase 1** (2-3 hours):
   - Add exchange accept button to UI
   - Show exchanges in transaction timeline
   - Exchange filtering by status

2. **Phase 2** (4-5 hours):
   - Asset detail modal with full history
   - Portfolio analytics dashboard
   - Exchange counter-offers

3. **Phase 3** (8-10 hours):
   - Database migration (PostgreSQL)
   - Multi-asset bundle support
   - Market price tracking
   - Automated valuation
