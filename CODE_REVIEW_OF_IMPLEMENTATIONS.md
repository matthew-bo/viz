## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION 1: SSE Reconnection Recovery

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` (lines 102-318)

### What Was Implemented
- Track last event timestamp on every SSE message
- Fallback polling when disconnected (every 30s)
- Fetch missed events on reconnect
- User feedback via toasts

### ✅ CORRECTNESS REVIEW

**Does it solve the problem?**  
✅ YES - Users will no longer lose transactions during disconnections

**Implementation Quality:**  
✅ Tracks timestamp correctly (`lastEventTime = Date.now()`)  
✅ Polling starts on error, stops on reconnect  
✅ Filters recent transactions with 60s buffer  
✅ Uses `addOrUpdateTransaction` to prevent duplicates  

### ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

**Issue 1: Dependencies in useEffect**  
- ❌ Had: `}, [addOrUpdateTransaction, setConnectionStatus, toast])`
- ✅ Fixed to: `}, [])`
- **Reason:** SSE should only connect once on mount, not re-establish on every render

**Issue 2: Missing dependencies in loadInitialData**  
- ❌ Had: `}, [setParties, setTransactions])`  
- ✅ Fixed to: `}, [setParties, setTransactions, setSelectedBusiness, setSelectedRWA])`
- **Reason:** Uses setSelectedBusiness and setSelectedRWA, must be in deps

### 🎯 DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS

**Positive:**
- Zero data loss during disconnections ✅
- Activity log has full audit trail ✅
- Toast notifications keep users informed ✅

**Potential Issues:**
- Polling every 30s might be aggressive on bandwidth
  - **Mitigation:** Only polls when disconnected, stops immediately on reconnect
- Client-side filtering of "recent" transactions
  - **Better:** Backend should support `?since=` parameter (noted in TODO)
  - **Current:** Works but fetches more than needed

### ✅ VERDICT: **PRODUCTION READY**
Minor optimization possible (backend `?since` parameter), but current implementation is solid and solves the critical data loss problem.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION 2: useTransactionAction Hook

### Files Created
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTransactionAction.tsx`

### What Was Implemented
- Hook to prevent race conditions
- Per-transaction loading state tracking
- Consistent error handling
- Automatic cleanup

### ✅ CORRECTNESS REVIEW

**Does it solve the problem?**  
✅ YES - Prevents duplicate submissions via Set of active IDs

**Implementation Quality:**  
✅ Uses Set for O(1) duplicate checking  
✅ Proper cleanup in finally block  
✅ useCallback for performance  
✅ Returns loading state per ID  

### ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES FOUND

**Issue 1: processingIds in useCallback dependency**  
```typescript
const executeAction = useCallback(..., [processingIds, toast]);
```
- ⚠️ **Analysis:** processingIds changes on every execution
- ⚠️ **Effect:** executeAction reference changes frequently
- ✅ **Verdict:** This is actually CORRECT - we need fresh processingIds
- **Why:** The check `if (processingIds.has(id))` must use current state

**Issue 2: Re-throwing error**  
```typescript
throw error; // Re-throw for caller to handle if needed
```
- ✅ **Analysis:** Allows caller to handle errors if needed
- ✅ **Verdict:** Good design - hook doesn't swallow errors

### 🎯 DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS

**Positive:**
- Prevents all race conditions ✅
- Reusable across components ✅
- Consistent UX everywhere ✅

**Potential Issues:**
- None identified

### ✅ useOptimisticUpdate Hook

**Bonus Implementation:**  
Also included in same file, provides optimistic UI updates with automatic rollback.

**Quality:** ✅ Excellent  
**Ready to use:** ✅ Yes (not yet integrated)

### ✅ VERDICT: **PRODUCTION READY**
No issues found. Excellent implementation of race condition prevention.

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION 3: MainContent Loading States

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/MainContent.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/TransactionTimeline.tsx`

### What Was Implemented
- Integrated useTransactionAction hook
- Added isAccepting prop to TransactionTimeline
- Loading spinner in Accept button
- Disabled button state

### ✅ CORRECTNESS REVIEW

**Does it solve the problem?**  
✅ YES - Users see clear feedback, can't double-click

**Implementation Quality:**  
✅ Hook integrated correctly  
✅ Props passed properly  
✅ Button disabled during processing  
✅ Spinner + text feedback  

### ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND

**Issue 1: Incomplete implementation**  
- ✅ MainContent - DONE
- ❌ SynchronizerFooter - NOT DONE
- ❌ TransactionGrid - NOT DONE
- ⚠️ TransactionCard - Need to verify

**Verdict:** Partially complete, needs finishing

### 🎯 DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS

**Positive:**
- Clear user feedback ✅
- Prevents errors ✅

**Remaining Work:**
- Must update SynchronizerFooter.tsx
- Must update TransactionGrid.tsx
- Must verify TransactionCard.tsx

### ⏳ VERDICT: **INCOMPLETE**
What's done is correct, but need to apply pattern to remaining components.

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION 4: Zustand Persistence Fix

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` (lines 51-54)

### What Was Implemented
- Clear `selectedBusiness` and `selectedRWA` on app init
- Console log for debugging

### ✅ CORRECTNESS REVIEW

**Does it solve the problem?**  
✅ YES - Filters cleared on fresh session

**Implementation Quality:**  
✅ Placed in loadInitialData (correct location)  
✅ Clears both filter types  
✅ Logs for debugging  

### ⚠️ MISSING IMPLEMENTATION

**Issue 1: No visual indicator**  
- ❌ Users still don't know filters were active previously
- ❌ No "Active Filters" banner component (in TODO)

**Issue 2: No user preference**  
- ❌ No "Remember my filters" checkbox (nice-to-have)

### 🎯 DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS

**Positive:**
- No stale filter confusion ✅

**Remaining Work:**
- Should add Active Filters banner (TODO: week2-4)
- Could add user preference option (future)

### ✅ VERDICT: **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**
Core fix is done (clears filters), but UI indicator still missing.

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION 5: Date Sorting NaN Fix

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/store/useAppStore.ts` (lines 140-151)

### What Was Implemented
- Check for NaN in date parsing
- Push invalid dates to end
- Proper sorting logic

### ✅ CORRECTNESS REVIEW

**Does it solve the problem?**  
✅ YES - App won't crash on invalid dates

**Implementation Quality:**  
✅ Checks both dates for NaN  
✅ Handles all NaN scenarios correctly  
✅ Maintains sort order for valid dates  

### Code Review:
```typescript
const timeA = new Date(a.recordTime).getTime();
const timeB = new Date(b.recordTime).getTime();

if (isNaN(timeA) && isNaN(timeB)) return 0;  // ✅ Both invalid - equal
if (isNaN(timeA)) return 1;   // ✅ A invalid - push to end
if (isNaN(timeB)) return -1;  // ✅ B invalid - push to end

return timeB - timeA;  // ✅ Both valid - newest first
```

**Logic Verification:**
- timeB - timeA: If B is newer (larger timestamp), result is positive, B comes first ✅
- Invalid dates: Correctly pushed to end ✅
- Equal invalid dates: Return 0 (stable sort) ✅

### 🎯 DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS

**Positive:**
- No crashes on bad data ✅
- Graceful degradation ✅

**Potential Issues:**
- None identified

### ✅ VERDICT: **PRODUCTION READY**
Perfect implementation, no issues.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION 6: fetchWithTimeout Utility

### Files Created
- `frontend/src/utils/fetchWithTimeout.ts`

### What Was Implemented
- Timeout wrapper for fetch()
- AbortController for cancellation
- Custom TimeoutError class
- Enhanced error messages

### ✅ CORRECTNESS REVIEW

**Does it solve the problem?**  
✅ YES - Prevents infinite loading

**Implementation Quality:**  
✅ Proper use of AbortController  
✅ Cleanup with clearTimeout  
✅ Distinguishes timeout from other errors  
✅ Type-safe with TypeScript  

### ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

**Issue 1: NOT INTEGRATED ANYWHERE**  
- ✅ Utility created
- ❌ NOT used in apiClient.ts
- ❌ NOT used anywhere in the app

**Verdict:** Implementation is correct but incomplete

### Code Review:
```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), finalTimeout);

try {
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    ...fetchOptions,
    signal: controller.signal  // ✅ Correct
  });
  clearTimeout(timeoutId);  // ✅ Cleanup on success
  return response;
} catch (error) {
  clearTimeout(timeoutId);  // ✅ Cleanup on error
  
  if (error instanceof Error && error.name === 'AbortError') {
    throw new TimeoutError(finalTimeout);  // ✅ Proper error transformation
  }
  throw error;  // ✅ Re-throw other errors
}
```

**Logic:** ✅ Perfect  
**Integration:** ❌ Missing

### 🎯 DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS

**Positive (when integrated):**
- No infinite loading states
- Clear timeout errors

**Current State:**
- Zero effect (not used anywhere)

### ⏳ VERDICT: **INCOMPLETE**
Correct implementation, but MUST integrate into apiClient.ts (TODO: week2-6)
